Pusher for Perl

These are sample programs to show how to use Pusher (http://pusher.com/) from
Perl.

pusher-client sends events to a single Pusher channel.

pusher-listener implements a WebSocket client that subscribes to a channel and
then dumps events that arrive.

This is just a starting point. You'll need to add error checks and recovery at
least, and probably a whole lot more. I'd love it if someone would turn these
into proper modules sometime (particularly the listener). You'll need a decent
understanding of AnyEvent and the Pusher API reference handy. But its ok, you
can do it!
